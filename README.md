<h1>MyFinances for World of Warcraft</h1>

This is an AddOn for World of Warcraft that allows you to keep track of your finances. 
- How much did you spent this session? 
- How much did you earn? 
- What's the total balance? 
<strong>This AddOn will allow you to know.</strong>

<h4>The current version is 0.0.8. It is the first one and even though it does a good job, its functionality is still very limited.</h4>

<h4>Feel free to submit any proposals.</h4>

<h3>I am already working on the following improvements:</h3>
<h4>- Tabs (or windows) that allow you to see how much money you earned in the past sessions, up to 7 days</h4>
<h4>Maybe up to 1 month...I don't know how difficult that'd be</h4>
